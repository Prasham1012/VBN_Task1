# VBN_Task1
the code moves thus:

1) putting in the initial conditions from the given questions and initialising the arrays resectively
2) finding phi and tau matrices for the analytical solution
3) discretisation and comparison
  a. analytical solution
  b. RungeKutta method
  c. matlab func ode45 solution
4) the plots have the three elements of the position vector plotted with time
5) the file func1.m contains the diff equation as well as the input function

For running:

1) Run main_task1 directly to obtain phi and tau values
2) Run rk4.m, ide45taskA.m, and analytical.m by themselves to obtain plots
3) the initial condition, array initialization, and function codes can be found separately in the file but need not be run run seprately to implement the codes above
4) time step and duration can be altered in the initialization code
